# Calculator-JS
In future, I plan on

1. making it support keyboard
2. making the equal sign spammable so that it can constantly follow operation based on the result and its latest number given.

For example (for number 2):
1.  100 - 10 = 90 (ANS)
2.  When pressed equal again 
- ANS - 10 = 80
- ANS - 10 = 70
- Ans - 10 = 60
- Ans - 10 = 50 etc.

I plan on making it work for all operators (+,-,*,/)
