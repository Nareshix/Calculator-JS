# Calculator-JS
In future, I plan on making the equal sign spammable so that it can constantly follow operation based on the result and its latest number given.

For example:
1.  100 - 10 = 90 (ANS)
2.  When pressed equal again 
- ANS - 10 = 80
- ANS - 10 = 70
- Ans - 10 = 60
- Ans - 10 = 50 etc.

I plan on making it work for all operators (+,-,*,/)
